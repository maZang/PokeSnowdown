#Proposal	
*Our project will be adding to an existing project called Pokémon Snowdown located at https://github.com/maZang/PokeSnowdown

*Pokémon Snowdown is a working Pokémon battle simulator however due to time constraints the creators were not able to implement all of content from the actual Pokémon games
*We wish to append some of the information they did not include, such as adding missing moves/items


#Objectives/Learning Outcomes
*Add the missing moves/items to the game so that it is more complete
*Learn about OCaml(a new language) in order to work on this project
*Learn about working in a group environment and meeting deadlines
*Learn how to give and receive code reviews 
*Get our fork accepted by the main repository so that we contribute back to the source
