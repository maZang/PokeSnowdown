Our group has all installed the virtual machine necessary to run the Pokemon Snowdown program
and we have started looking at the basics of OCaml. We have identified things to change in 
the current project such as adding new moves, fixing the button graphics and adding new NPC's 
to the tournament mode.

We have started to add a lot of NPCS to the game and work on adding more documentation to
make how to install/play the game clearer. We have also added documentation on how anyone
can add an NPC to the game given they can install and the run the game. We also have 
decided to focus solely on improving the tournament mode/documentation.

We are wrapping up our changes to the game and getting ready to push them to the main 
repository so that our work will be added back to the main project.
