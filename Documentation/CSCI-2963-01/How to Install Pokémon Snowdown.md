So you have stumbled upon this game and are probably wondering, how can I Install it on my computer and play? The answer is it's not that simple. You will need to download and install the Cornell Virutal machine. I will walk through these steps with you.

For this tutorial I have created a new user account on my computer. The first step will be to download and install virtual box onto your computer. I am installing virtual box on windows in this example.

Once virutalbox is installed the next step is to download the OVA file (the file that will help set up your virtual machine). This download may take a while.

Find the OVF file you just downloaded and select it.

If the virutal machine asks you for a password, shut down the machine(press x and click power off the machine) then start it again.

If everything worked up to this point you should get to a screen looking like this. A basic knowledge of linux commands would be very helpful at this point, but this tutorial will walk you through what to do.
